            Sports play a important role in everyone's busy life especially for students. Being involved in sports activities benefits a person in many ways. It does not provide only physical strength however it increases mental power too. Sports are very beneficial to us  as they teach us punctuality, patient, discipline, teamwork and dedication. Playing sports help us in building and improving confidence level. If we practice sports on regular basis, we can be more active and healthy. <br>
            Our college's cultural club conducts a mega event with the cooperation and support of the respected teachers and honarable Principal Pangavhane Sir. This mega event  name is <i><b>COMBAT</b></i>.
